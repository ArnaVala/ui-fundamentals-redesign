# UI-Fundamentals-Redesign

## Redesign for Italia restaurant website

- I designed the front page and food menu page.
- I mainly used text available on the italia.is website.
- I played a bit around with form in the hero on the landing page which
continues throughout, and used golden lines for section divisions.
- I added a 'r√©ttur dagsins' (today's special) section and come CTA's.
- I created a table reservation form, and tried to structure the site's so that important info 
- such as opening times, reservation etc is displayed more prominently.

## UI design priciples used in this project

### Whitespace
I based spacing, lineheight and fontsize on a 8 point grid - verticle padding and margin between elements.
<br>
<br>
### Alignment
A 12 column grid for alignment and positioning of elements. 20px gutter.
<br>
<br>
### Typography
I used Heimat font family, Display for a more classic feel in the headings, and Heimat sans - 
a bit quirky but readable font for smaller font sizes and text.
I used 8point typographic scale. I used only one heading size for sections - a 20px main paragraph size.
<br>
<br>
### Color
I opted to try for a more sophisticated palette for the redesign - using a deep green/ gold color palette. 
I used a deep dark zuccini green color as the base color, for the dark background and text colors on light bg. 
I chose Gold tones to compliment the green and tints of the gold-base-color as a accent and for text on dark background. 
The lightest gold - is a creamy color for the light background areas.

### Contrast
I use A11y to check for optimal color contrast - dark fonts on the light background on text - gold for accent, 
and used lighter tints where needing more contrast on the dark bg.
